       <p>i first heard about professor ricard because of a video of a ted x talk that he gave that found itself rather rapidly spread around the mathematical community on the internet.

this talk had a rather unique topic.

it was about, well you know what, it might be better to let him tell you about it.

so you you do electronic engineering. i'm not here to talk to you about that technically.

my phd is actually in applied mathematics uh applied and computational mathematics but i've always had a very keen interest in music uh and my undergraduate degrees were in electronic engineering uh specifically in sonar uh sound processing so i guess i started my career in kind of audio processing of sonar sounds and i've kind of stayed in audio theme my entire life always with this background passion around music. unfortunately my abilities aren't the same as my passion for music. so uh that's why i'm a practicing mathematician with an interest in music rather than the other way around.</p>

        <p>No one else had been called, so why me? I ran down a list of recent crimes, looking for a conviction that might stick. Setting fire to a reportedly flameproof Halloween costume, stealing a set of barbecue tongs from an unguarded patio, altering the word hit on a list of rules posted on the gymnasium door; never did it occur to me that I might be innocent.</p>

        <p>Though she seemed old at the time, the agent was most likely fresh out of college. She walked beside me and asked what appeared to be an innocent and unrelated question: "So, which do you like better, State or Carolina?"</p>

        <p>She was referring to the athletic rivalry between the Triangle area's two largest universities.</p>
