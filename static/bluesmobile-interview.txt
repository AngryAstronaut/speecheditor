                                 Blues interview



  Ben:              All right. So, uh, let me welcome Bettye LaVette to the
                    Bluesmobile. Let me welcome you ba-, welcome you back to the show.

  Bettye LaVette:   Oh, thank you so much, baby. It's good to be back.

  Ben:              Yeah, it's wonderful to see you. You, it's, you sound and look so
                    great and, and powerful and you seem to, to really be on a roll
                    right now.

  Bettye:           Yeah, well, it, it's, my record company keeps saying, in fact, that
                    I rock and I keep telling them that I do, in fact, roll.

                    [laughter]

  Bettye:           That is, that is what I do.

  Ben:              Both rock and roll.

  Bettye:           No, I just roll at this point. [laughs] I used to rock, but now I
                    just roll. [laughs]

  Ben:              When you...Well, it's interesting, rock and roll, thankful and
                    thoughtful. When, when you say thankful and thoughtful, what, what
                    do you mean by that?

  Bettye:           Well, who else do you know who's, who's over 60 years old who is
                    not a has been but who is indeed a never was, who suddenly has a, a
                    career just dumped into their lap? I'm, uh, you know, it's not
                    something that I, I sought and then quit and got a day gig and gave
                    up. This was something that I worked on every day for 50 years. It
                    was just that some days, they only paid me $50 for it.

                    But, um, I'm, I'm extremely thankful and, uh, thoughtful. I'm
                    reflective, just because I'm old, but I'm, I'm, uh, thankful
                    because of all the things that are finally happening to me.

  Ben:              [laughs] I know, it, it seems like, in reading the book, it's like,
                    as soon as you get there, they move the there. You know what I
                    mean?

  Bettye:           Yeah, but, look at, look at the entire record industry. I finally
                    found someone who believes in me, a record company who has faith in
                    me and the whole record industry has crashed.

                    [laughter]

  Bettye:           It's, it's incredible. I meant that we have a thing that we
                    associate with me called buzzard luck and it seems like it's, it's
                    just perpetual. No matter how, how good things get.

                    [laughter]

  Ben:              Well, well thinking about, about buzzard luck. I, I, I, I'd love to
                    hear the story of about a little Willie John, and how he came to
                    your rescue because a lot of people don't realize how great Willie
                    John was.

  Bettye:           They would if they had to come on behind him. [laughs] He, um,
                    really just, um, I really didn't know him that well, it was just,
                    um, maybe a month into my career, so I, everything that was
                    happening to me was a first, and I was in a, a place called Sir
                    John's Night Beat in Miami, Florida, in, in 1962, 3, [laughs] .

                    And, um, I lost my voice because I would never stop talking, and I
                    would never go to bed. So, I [laughs] invariably lost my voice,
                    and, um, I was struggling so badly on, through the song, um, it was
                    just impossible for me to go on. I, I'd really lost my voice, and
                    he came up and just sat on the, on the stage, on the, on the, lip
                    of the stage, you know, with his legs dangling over and when he
                    went in to talk to me, the people weren't even aware that I'd lost
                    my voice.

                    [laughter]

  Ben:              What was, what was his show like, what was the, the, Little, Little
                    Willie John's show like?

  Bettye:           I didn't see his show. I didn't see his show, no, that, that time,
                    he was really kind of a hanger-on at, at Sir John's and he was just
                    in there every night. And that was where he was living at the time.

  Ben:              Hmm-mm.

  Bettye:           And there was, it was a hotel, and a lounge. And most of the, the,
                    the singers that, that you wondered where they went. Hank Ballard
                    for a while, Willie John, most of the people you wondered where
                    they had gone from, from the late '50s and early '60s, they were
                    living at Sir John's.

                    [laughter]

  Ben:              Well, [clears throat] what is it about, I mean, I'm trying to pop
                    it around here because, you know, I love your book and I love your
                    record. I, I want to talk about both, um, why, what prompted you to
                    write the book?

  Bettye:           Money. [laughs] No, it really, it, it wasn't a thing that I, I felt
                    I needed to say. It wasn't um, something I had been longing to say.
                    In fact, it was something that I thought that would be written
                    after my death.

                    I thought it was probably something maybe my grandchildren or my
                    husband would pursue. But it certainly was not something that I
                    intended to write or ever thought that I would. I'm just so amazed
                    that it's done. There's a book out about me. [laughs] That's just
                    so amazing to me.

  Ben:              What was the process like? What did, what, you know, what was it
                    like working with David Ritz and, and, and putting you know, going
                    living through all this again?

  Bettye:           Well it, it, it was more difficult than I thought because I thought
                    it would be very much like what you and I are doing right now.
                    Just, you know, conversating it. I, I would tell a few stories, and
                    then you say and then what happened, and whatever.

                    But David Ritz was like...A lot of my standard stories was, "Well,
                    I know everybody in Detroit black over 50." Or, "I know everybody
                    at, at Motown no matter how, what age. I knew them when they were
                    either drunk, or broke, or, or, or all of them at one time. Or
                    naked. All at one time."

                    And when I would tell this story, people would, would just chuckle,
                    you know -- over the years. And when I said those kind of things to
                    David Ritz he said, "And which ones were they? And what were you
                    doing at the time?" [laughs]

                    So, it was much different than I thought it would be. I thought I'd
                    just pop in, do these little hits, and quit. But I found very soon
                    that it really would have been like gossip had I not talked, had I
                    not said where I was and what I was doing at the time.

  Ben:              Right, right. Because, 'cause it all ties in to, to, to you...

  Bettye:           Mm-hmm.

  Ben:              I mean you're, you're the thing that, that, that runs through it
                    all.

  Bettye:           Yeah, well the book is about me, you know. And these just happen to
                    be the people that I knew.

  Ben:              Hmm. And, and I would imagine that you know it didn't seem out of
                    the ordinary that all of this was going on. That, that this just
                    seemed like life the way life was supposed to be.

  Bettye:           Oh, it was very, very life the way we felt that it should be.
                    Nobody...these things that sound so sensational now, they were just
                    the things that happened when we talk, um...when I talk in the book
                    about, about, um, Diane Ross and the people at Motown, these were
                    the things that we all talked about it.

                    This is, when we were all together, this is what we talked about.
                    And these are the things we said. This wasn't, these weren't just
                    thoughts that I was harboring or whatever, this is the talk of the
                    day.

  Ben:              [laughs] What is, what is it do you suppose now, now that you've,
                    you've, you really thought about it some more and, and you're
                    looking back a little more, what is it about Detroit that launched
                    all these musical careers, not just Motown, but so many others?

  Bettye:           I really don't know, and I would really liken it to phenomenal.
                    Because in Chicago, uh, you could say all those people came from
                    the South and they played guitars and harmonicas. In New York,
                    there's all the lights and the dances and the theater. In, in LA,
                    there's the movies and whatever. But there was no reason for that
                    to happen in Detroit. I, I just think it's totally phenomenal.

                    I have...It, it, it's noted for cars and, and for factories and
                    that kind of thing. It's not necessarily just noted, even when,
                    when the chitlin circuit or when the theater circuit was really
                    big, while Detroit was big during those times, it wasn't a thing
                    where people were leaving their homes trying to get to Detroit to
                    be in show business. You know, so I just think it's a phenomenon.

  Ben:              Hmmm, hmmm. And to, to just to have so many talented people, um,
                    you know, around and then, you know, to have a vehicle for it, too,
                    the, the new record company...

                    [crosstalk]

  Bettye:           Then, I guess, too, there was the fear of having to work in one of
                    the factories.

                    [laughter]

  Bettye:           So you went to think of something else.

  Ben:              [laughs] Now, now, um, did you, when you were in Detroit, did you
                    ever come across John Lee Hooker when you were there?

  Bettye:           No, I didn't. Uh, you know, when I started, uh, in 1962, blues was
                    kind of knowing down to, we were, we were rapidly running from
                    blues. In fact, I, I laugh now in, in reflection when I think about
                    how, when they used to put a BB King show together and everybody
                    said, "Oh, no, I don't want to be like..." You know if you were
                    going into like the Regal Theater or the Apollo and BB was going to
                    be starring the show, you knew there was going to be another John
                    Lee Hooker or somebody like that on.

                    But you wanted all your friends and the young fly people of the
                    day. So by the time I started, John Lee Hooker was even farther out
                    of it than, than BB King was and BB was on his way, kind of out,
                    and rhythm and blues was burgeoning and, and becoming the thing. It
                    was more black people disowning blues than anything else that, that
                    caused its demise early on.
