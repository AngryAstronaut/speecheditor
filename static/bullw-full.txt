  Julia:            Sound test? OK. OK. [pauses] I don't know if I'm going to be able
                    to. My nose just got plugged up when I...all right. I'll try,
                    though. OK. Oh, god.
                    He's not just a fan. Whenever Bullwinkle makes an appearance these
                    days, that's Keith Scott behind the antlers. He took over as the
                    official voiceover guy in the early '90s. And unofficially, he's
                    the closest thing to a Bullwinkle historian. He's the author of
                    "The Moose That Roared," a book that tells the saga of "The Rocky &
                    Bullwinkle Show."

                    "Plucky and innocent." That doesn't really describe America during
                    the Cold War, let alone America today. But Jay Ward tapped into the
                    things we most want to believe about ourselves as a nation. And
                    maybe that means we all live in a country that doesn't exist.

                    [laughs] I think that's because I'm sick. [laughs] Oh, man. OK, I
                    think that that's it for now. Thanks, Josh. Sorry for so much
                    strife.

  Julia:            For TV audiences in the early '60s, that was a big leap from the
                    recycled gags of shows like "The Flintstones." In episode one,
                    Bullwinkle sets off an international incident when a pie he's
                    making turns out to be the recipe for a super powerful jet fuel.
