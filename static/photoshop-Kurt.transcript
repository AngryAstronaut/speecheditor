[{"line": "Maneesh, welcome into the studio.", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "So, Photoshop 1 point oh came out in nineteen ninety, just as I was involved in a magazine that spent many, many thousands of dollars we didn't have manipulating photographs with expensive computer time. It changed the world, obviously, and there's been a new version every couple of years since. But how, has there been much improvement from what Photoshop 1 point oh could do to what it can do today? What is the computer power and the computer changes behind that in the last 22 years?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "If we were to chart how much it's changed, how much more useful it's gotten, did most of that happen in the first 5 or 10 years and now it's just slight refinements? Or is it still becoming, in a practical sense, more powerful all the time?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "It became, the digital camera became absolutely, literally ubiquitous.", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Photoshop is now, like Google or like Thermos or Kleenex used to be, the synonym for all photo manipulation software. Are there important kinds of photo manipulation software we should be aware of? Or is Photoshop not only what they're all called, but the best?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Do any of those do what they do differently? Or is it all the same basic skinning of the cat in the same way?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "And do you foresee anytime soon, or not soon, five years, ten years. Will...can you imagine some new disruptively, transformational invention? Or, or, or did that happen in nineteen ninety, and now it's going to be slight refinements?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Of course, you'd be about to become a zillionaire, if you did.", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Well, and, and, yet again it, it means that the moment at which your photograph is taken, which used to be sort of everything in photography, is no longer necessarily so salient.", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "What about image recognition? Which I know is, is making great advances. We talked to somebody at Columbia not long ago, who is one of the leaders in that field, is...do you think that will have it's, it's kind of consumer break-out moment? The same way Photoshop did 20 years ago?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "So we are being crowd sourced, every time we post a photograph to Facebook?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Now all these kinds of technologies one can imagine various Orwellian one. The kind of banal consumerist one. And then perhaps do, do those ethical issues and, and possible scenarios weigh on the minds of technologists? Or do they just do what they do because it's an interesting problem to solve today?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Yes. It's good to get crooks until they, somebody decides I'm the crook.", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Um, there's an interesting double thing going on. On the one hand we have cameras everywhere in everyone's pocket. So all these images of reality are able to be taken all the time. We see that when people take pictures of bad beatings happening, of bad things happening. And yet, these Photo Shop and these digital tools give us the means to, to, to alter what used to be absolutely verifiable versions of reality. And, and, and make them fictional. Are, are those two possibilities intention and does the ubiquity of cameras sort of protect us from the, the digital manipulation falling into the wrong hands?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Which has always been true. But now, you really should be conscious of that.", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Well, and there is I know, a field of, of, of image forensics where people specialize in detecting how and if images are manipulated. Is that a, is that a robust thing? Can, can, could I give you an image and you could tell me if somebody had worked it over or not?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "So it's like spam.", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "And, but, and are those tools yet in a, in a consumer app form? Where, where individuals, as you say, individuals ought to be aware that every image is authored and you, know be skeptical. But is there, is there a software tool that I could apply to any image, any given image I'm looking at?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "How does that work, roughly?", "speaker": "Kurt"}, {"line": "Is it pretty reliable?", "speaker": "Kurt"}]
