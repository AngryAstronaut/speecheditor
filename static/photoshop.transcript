        "line": "So, Photoshop 1.0 came out in nineteen ninety, just as I was involved in a magazine that spent many, many thousands of dollars we didn't have manipulating photographs with expensive computer time. It changed the world, obviously, and there's been a new version every couple of years since. But how, has there been much improvement from what Photoshop 1.0 could do to what it can do today? What is the computer power and the computer changes behind that in the last 22 years?", 
        "speaker": "Kurt"
    }, 
    {
        "line": "Photoshop has evolved quite a bit over the last 20, 25 years. It's become much more powerful in the sense that it's become easier and easier to manipulate images. Back when it was Photoshop 1.0, you could go in and touch every pixel in an image and change its color and create all kinds of effects that way. What's happened over the years is that they've built in a number of higher level tools, so at this point, you don't have to touch every single pixel.",

        "line": "If we were to chart how much it's changed, how much more useful it's gotten, did most of that happen in the first 5 or 10 years and now it's just slight refinements? Or is it still becoming, in a practical sense, more powerful all the time?", 
        "speaker": "Kurt"
    }, 
    {
        "line": "I think what's happened is that, later in the nineties, , digital photography exploded. It exploded once when digital cameras became commonplace. It exploded again when the web became very common, and Then, more recently, it's exploded yet again because we now take pictures with our cell phones.",

        "line": "That's right, and sharing of those images also became ubiquitous. One of the things that people often do is they take their photographs and then load them into a tool like Photoshop in order to adjust them a little bit.",

    {
        "line": "Photoshop is now, like Google or like Thermos or Kleenex used to be, the synonym for all photo manipulation software. Are there important kinds of photo manipulation software we should be aware of? Or is Photoshop not only what they're all called, but the best?", 
        "speaker": "Kurt"

    {
        "line": "I think Photoshop is perhaps the most well known, even still. There are many, many other photo manipulation tools available.

    {
        "line": "They're mostly the same. They apply the same kinds of algorithms. There are some differences. Some of the tools that you find in Photoshop are not found in other tools. Photoshop tends to be the higher end version of image manipulation software.",

        "speaker": "Kurt"

        "line": " Right, but um, but, but things have gotten disrupted. Ah, It was, you know, Photoshop first came out, and as I said, then the ubiquity of digital cameras, and the Web, and cell phone cameras. Each one of those, ah, disrupted the way we deal with digital photo...the way we deal with digital photographs. Um, and, ah, and I can imagine that kind of disruption may happen again. So, video is an obvious candidate. You're already seeing sites like YouTube, that are changing the way we distribute video, ah, people are becoming more, and more interested in taking video, and editing video. And so tools for making video are on the horizon, I think. Um, There's also advances in camera technologies, so you may have heard of this new camera, the Lightro? Ah, it's a camera that takes an image, that can then be refocused after you've taken the image, um, and that might change the way people create photographs, the kinds of photographs that they take, ah, how we interact with photographs.",

        "line": "Well, and, and, yet again it, it means that the moment at which your photograph is taken, which used to be sort of everything in photography, is no longer necessarily so salient.",

    {
        "line": "That's right, yeah. It changes the way we think about what a photograph is.",

    {
        "line": "What about image recognition? Which I know is, is making great advances. We talked to somebody at Columbia not long ago, who is one of the leaders in that field, is...do you think that will have it's, it's kind of consumer break-out moment? The same way Photoshop did 20 years ago?", 
        "speaker": "Kurt"
    }, 
    {
        "line": "Yeah, it's a great question. Ah, I think we're already starting to Facebook are heavily invested in this, ah, it should be the case, that when you upload a photograph to these sites, they're trying to do recognition on them to figure out which of your friends are in those photographs. Um, I think, ah, I think we're going to see that happening more and more.", 
        "speaker": "Maneesh"
    }, 
    {
        "line": "So we are being crowd sourced, every time we post a photograph to Facebook?", 
        "speaker": "Kurt"
    }, 
    {
        "line": "Yeah. Or, or being analyzed in some sense. So that's one thing. I think you'll see other kinds of recognition as well. So I think there's great interest in being able to recognize the clothing that you're wearing or other contextual elements. Uh, are you standing in front of, uh you know, a well known building. Are you standing in front of uh, uh, you know, the here for uh, different kinds of uh, recognition and recognition that will lead to various kinds of monetization as well.", 
        "speaker": "Maneesh"
    }, 
    {
        "line": "Now all these kinds of technologies one can imagine various Orwellian one. The kind of banal consumerist one. And then perhaps do, do those ethical issues and, and possible scenarios weigh on the minds of technologists? Or do they just do what they do because it's an interesting problem to solve today?", 
        "speaker": "Kurt"
    }, 
    {
        "line": "Well, I think that we do think about the...you know I certainly think about the ethical issues. And as you say, there are a number of them around any technology that's being created. Or really any The results that you produce can be used in a good, in a positive way, in a negative way. Or maybe they won't have a real effect as you're suggesting. I think uh, it's important to think about where the balance lies. If there's, you know, a lot of good that can come from the tools that you're developing that's great. Um, but there's always ways in which the tools that you're developing can be used for uh, unethical things.",

        "line": "Yes. It's good to get crooks until they, somebody decides I'm the crook.",

    {
        "line": "Um, there's an interesting double thing going on. On the one hand we have cameras everywhere in everyone's pocket. So all these images of reality are able to be taken all the time. We see that when people take pictures of bad beatings happening, of bad things happening. And yet, these Photo Shop and these digital tools give us the means to, to, to alter what used to be absolutely verifiable versions of reality. And, and, and make them fictional. Are, are those two possibilities intention and does the ubiquity of cameras sort of protect us from the, the digital manipulation falling into the wrong hands?", 
        "speaker": "Kurt"

    {
        "line": "I don't think it protects us. I think that um, what is changing and needs to change is that uh, people who view photographs need to understand that there was an author who cre...who took that photograph. There was someone who decided what photograph to take, and possibly also manipulated that photograph in a variety of ways.",

        "line": "Well, and there is I know, a field of, of, of image forensics where people specialize in detecting how and if images are manipulated. Is that a, is that a robust thing? Can, can, could I give you an image and you could tell me if somebody had worked it over or not?", 
        "speaker": "Kurt"

    {
        "line": "Yeah, so there are tools available that will analyze a digital image and help to determine whether some kinds of manipulations have taken place. These tools are not perfect today. They're getting better and better. Um, but it will always be a uh, cat and mouse game. So as soon as I come up with a uh, new way to detect manipulation, the manipulators will come up with a new way to manipulate.",

Where, where individuals, as you say, individuals ought to be aware that every image is authored and you, know be skeptical. But is there, is there a software tool that I could apply to any image, any given image I'm looking at?", 
        "speaker": "Kurt"

        "line": "Yeah, so uh, recently uh, there's been a tool that's uh, come out of a company called 4N6, or forensics.  And uh, they uh, they produce a uh, plugin to Photoshop that will detect certain kinds of manipulations on photos. It's mostly being used by law enforcement and lawyers.",

    }, 
    {
        "line": "There are different things, there are different techniques that have been proposed, but one of the things that it does is that it analyzes the compression that's been used on the photographs. When you use JPEG to compress an image, for example, it leaves behind a little bit of a signature. That signature is slightly different depending on the exact algorithm that you use, and so this tool looks for those changes to the signature in the JPEG compression. In particular, when you use Photoshop on an image, the parts where you've used Photoshop have a slightly different signature than the parts where you haven't used Photoshop. It uses that to detect.",
