I first heard about Professor Ricard because of a video of a TED X talk that he gave that found itself rather rapidly spread around the mathematical community on the internet.

This talk had a rather unique topic.

It was about, well you know what, it might be better to let him tell you about it.

So you you do electronic engineering. I'm not here to talk to you about that technically. {laugh}

My ph d is actually in applied mathematics uh applied and computational mathematics but i've always had a very keen interest in music uh and my undergraduate degrees were in uh electronic engineering specifically in sonar uh sound processing so i guess i started my career in uh kind of audio processing of sonar sounds and i've kind of stayed in the audio theme my entire life always with this background passion around music. um Unfortunately my abilities aren't the same as my passion for music. So uh that's why i'm a practicing mathematician uh with an interest in music as opposed to the other way around.
