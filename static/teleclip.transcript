[{"line": "I really don't know and i would really uh uh liken it to phenomenal because in Chicago you could say all those people came from the South and they played guitars and harmonica. And New York there's all the lights and the dancers and the theater. And in uh LA there's there's the movies and whatever but there was no reason for that to happen in Detroit. I I just think it's totally phenomenal I have... it it you know it's noted for cars! And and for factories and that kind of thing. It's not necessarily just noted even when... when the the chit lin circuit or when the uh theater circuit was really big. While Detroit was big during those times it wasn't a thing where people were leaving their homes trying to get to Detroit to be in show business. You know so it's I just think it's a phenomenon.", "speaker": "Speaker"}]
